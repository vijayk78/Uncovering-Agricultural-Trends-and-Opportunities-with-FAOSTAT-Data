# Uncovering-Agricultural-Trends-and-Opportunities-with-FAOSTAT-Data
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify trends and opportunities within the agricultural sector across various countries and crops using the FAOSTAT dataset.
•	What are the trends in crop yields over the past decade for various countries?
	Calculated the average yield for each area.
	Got the top 10 areas based on average yield.
	Filtered the data frame to include only the top 10 areas.
	Plotted the yield trends for these top 10 areas and obtained the summary statistics.
•	Count shows the number of yield records for each year. The count varies slightly year by year, indicating a relatively consistent number of data points collected annually.

•	The mean (average) crop yield shows a slight increasing trend over the years, starting from 671,453 in 2016 to 726,737 in 2022. This suggests an overall improvement in crop yields.


•	The standard deviation is very high, indicating a wide variation in yield values. This large variation could be due to different crop types, regions, and farming practices.

•	The minimum value for crop yield is 0.0 for all years. This could indicate instances where certain crops failed completely or data was not recorded accurately.


•	The 25th percentile shows the yield value below which 25% of the data points fall. This value is relatively stable around 2,000 to 2,100, indicating that a quarter of the yields are consistently low.

•	The median (50th percentile) values are in the range of approximately 20,000 to 21,335, indicating that half of the data points have yields below this range. This shows a slight upward trend over the years, reflecting gradual improvement in median crop yields.


•	The 75th percentile values show yields below which 75% of the data points fall. These values have a gradual increase, suggesting that the top 25% of yields are improving.

•	The maximum yield values show substantial fluctuations, with the highest yields reaching up to approximately 439 million in 2022. These extreme values likely reflect outliers or exceptionally high yields in specific regions or crops.


•	Overall Increase in Average Yield: The mean crop yield has increased from 671,453 in 2016 to 726,737 in 2022, indicating an overall improvement in agricultural productivity over the decade.

•	Wide Variation in Yields: The high standard deviation and the presence of very high maximum values suggest significant variability in crop yields. This could be due to differences in geographical regions, crop types, farming techniques, and environmental conditions.


•	Consistent Low Yields: The 25th percentile values are relatively stable around 2,000, indicating that the lower quartile of crop yields has not seen significant improvement. This might point to challenges faced by certain regions or crops that consistently produce lower yields.

•	Improvement in Median and Higher Yields: The upward trend in the median and 75th percentile values indicates that the middle and higher yield-producing crops or regions are improving, contributing to the overall increase in average yields.


•	Outliers and Exceptional Yields: The extremely high maximum values suggest the presence of outliers or exceptional cases where yields are significantly higher than the average. These outliers could be due to advanced agricultural practices, favourable weather conditions, or specific high-yield crop varieties.

•	The trends in crop yields over the past decade show an overall improvement in agricultural productivity, with increasing average yields and better performance in the median and higher yield segments. However, the wide variation in yields and the consistent low yields for the lower quartile indicate areas where improvements are needed. Addressing the challenges faced by low-yield regions or crops and reducing the variability in yields could further enhance agricultural productivity.

Lasso Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Lasso Regression MSE: 8141336.52291233
Insight: The Lasso Regression model performs much worse than Ridge Regression. This indicates that the features in the dataset might not be sparse, or that Lasso’s ability to set some coefficients to zero is not beneficial for this problem.

Random Forest Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Random Forest Regression MSE: 36166277273.16929
Insight: The Random Forest model has a very high MSE, indicating poor performance compared to linear models. This might suggest that the data has a strong linear relationship that tree-based models fail to capture effectively.

Introduction
Goal of the Analysis:
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify trends and opportunities within the agricultural sector across various countries and crops using the FAOSTAT dataset. 
By examining key agricultural metrics such as area harvested, yield, and production volumes, we aim to uncover potential markets for agribusiness expansion, providing strategic insights for international growth.

FAOSTAT Dataset:
FAOSTAT, maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, offers comprehensive agricultural data from numerous countries. 
This dataset includes a wide array of metrics for various crops and livestock products, making it an invaluable resource for analysing agricultural trends globally.

Data Acquisition and Preparation
Data Collection:
The data was sourced directly from the FAOSTAT database, focusing on relevant agricultural metrics. This dataset encompasses information from different countries and years, offering a broad view of agricultural productivity and trends.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The dataset required several preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and usability. 
These steps included handling missing values, filtering relevant columns, and transforming data types. Key metrics such as area harvested, yield, and production volumes were extracted and cleaned for a more focused analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Key Metrics analysed:
The analysis centered on three primary metrics:
Area Harvested: The total area used for cultivating a particular crop.
Yield: The amount of crop produced per unit area.
Production Volumes: The total quantity of crop produced.

Initial Visualizations and Descriptive Statistics:
To understand the data better, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA), which included generating summary statistics and visualizing the distribution of key metrics.
 For instance, we examined the average yield of wheat across different countries to identify significant variations.

Trend Analysis
Methods Used to Analyse Trends:
Trend analysis was performed to identify growth patterns over time. We used statistical methods to analyse changes in yield, area harvested, and production volumes across different countries and crops.

Key Findings:
The analysis revealed several significant trends:
Consistent Growth in Crop Production: Certain countries showed a steady increase in production volumes for key crops, indicating robust agricultural practices and favourable conditions.
Improving Yields: Countries like Afghanistan demonstrated significant improvements in crop yields, particularly for almonds and wheat.
Expansion Opportunities: Countries with expanding agricultural productivity and consistent growth trends were identified as potential markets for agribusiness expansion.
Visualizations:
We created various plots to illustrate these trends. For example, a line chart showing the yield of almonds in Afghanistan over the past decade highlighted a positive growth trend, suggesting a promising market for expansion. 
Afghanistan: Significant improvement in almond yields.
Brazil and China: Steady growth in wheat and rice production.

Recommendations for Agribusiness Expansion:
To focus on expanding into Afghanistan for almonds, and explore opportunities in Brazil and China for wheat and rice.
To establish local partnerships, leverage existing infrastructure, and invest in technology to enhance productivity.

Data Limitations:
The FAOSTAT dataset, while comprehensive, may have gaps or inconsistencies in certain regions or time periods. These limitations could affect the analysis's accuracy.

External Factors:
Political, economic, and environmental factors impacting agriculture were not considered in this analysis, which could influence the trends observed.

Assumptions:
The analysis assumes that observed trends will continue in the future, which may not always be the case due to unforeseen changes in agricultural practices or environmental conditions.
